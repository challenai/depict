# Depict

**Depict** is a lightweight JavaScript library for building canvas-based user interfaces with ease. It provides a declarative approach to designing interactive and animated graphs without unnecessary complexity.

## 🌟 Features

### 🖋️ Declarative & Intuitive  
Create complex, event-driven, and animated graphs effortlessly. Depict’s declarative approach reduces cognitive load, allowing you to focus on logic rather than low-level rendering details.

### 🛠️ Simple & Maintainable  
Design intricate shapes using a straightforward node-based structure—no need for dedicated layout engines or positioning systems. Just define offsets, and Depict takes care of the rest. You don’t have to manage inter-component relationships or maintain complex application state synchronization.

### ⚡ Optimized for Performance  
Depict comes with built-in performance tuning, ensuring smooth rendering by default. If you need even more speed, optional optimization tools are available. Start building quickly and fine-tune later—Depict is fast enough for most use cases.

### 🔄 Flexible State Management  
Drive your graph using function variables, a simple state system, or even React/Vue state management. Depict integrates seamlessly with your preferred approach, eliminating the need for tedious shape-to-shape communication.

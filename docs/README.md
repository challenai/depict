# Depict

Depict is a JavaScript library for building canvas based user interface.

- Declarative: Depict makes it painless to create complex animation and events driven graph without mind burden.
- Maintainable: Organize simple and clear nodes to Create complex shapes, there are no specific positioning or layout engines included, the only thing you need to care about is its offset, nothing specific to learn. You don't need to consider the relationship among different components, nodes or shapes, and try to manage complex application state communication.
- Performance: Performance auto tuning battery is included. However, if you try to build something really fast, many optional performance tools are available. Demonstrate your app fastly and improve it later if it's necessary. But it's fast enough in most of the cases 
- Multi-pattern: You can build your graph driven by function varibles, or simple state, or even react state, vue state, the graph will be driven by what you expect, no annoying communication between shapes, elements...

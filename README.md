Depict is a JavaScript library for building canvas based user interface.

- Maintainable: You create complex shapes which organized as components, there are no specific positioning or layout engines included, the only thing you need to care about is its offset. You don't need to consider the relationship among different components or shapes, and try to manage complex application state or communication.
- Declarative: React makes it painless to create complex animation and events driven images without mind burden.
- Performance: Optional performance tools when it's necessary to improve, but performance auto tuning battery is included.

Depict is a JavaScript library for building canvas based user interface.

- Maintainable: Organize simple and clear nodes to Create complex shapes, there are no specific positioning or layout engines included, the only thing you need to care about is its offset, nothing specific to learn. You don't need to consider the relationship among different components, nodes or shapes, and try to manage complex application state or communication.
- Declarative: Depict makes it painless to create complex animation and events driven graph without mind burden.
- Performance: Performance auto tuning battery is included. However, if you try to build something really fast, many optional performance tools are available. Demonstrate your app fastly and improve it later if it's necessary. But it's fast enough in most of the cases :)
